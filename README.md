# Twitter Bot
This is a twitter bot that utilizes twitter API to control the account. It utilizess different API's and webscraping techniques to gather content to be shared on the twitter page. This bot is currently running on a low power machine ([Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)) to be set and forgotten. I consider this to be a long term project that I will be working on incrementally. More skills will be added in future versions.
